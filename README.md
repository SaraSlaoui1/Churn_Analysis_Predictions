# Churn_Analysis_Predictions
In this repo I will expose my analysis on a data set of a TeleCom company about customers infos using Python modules on one side and Power BI on the other. I will explore the correlations between the explaining features and the target class churn.  The goal of this project is to give some insights and accurate solutions/strategies to prevent churns.
